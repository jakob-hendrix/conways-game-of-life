# Conway's Game of Life

This is my follow along of Jeremy Clark's walkthrough of Conway's Game of Life.

The goal is to create a simulation that models cells that are either alive or dead based on the following rules:

* any live cell with fewer tan two live neighbors dies
* any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives.
* any live cell with more than three neighbors dies.
* any dead cell with three neighbors becomes a live cell
